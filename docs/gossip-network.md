# Gossip Network

To build a gossip network which fits to Ouroboros, consider the following:

1. Topic-Based Filtering: Implement a mechanism to filter messages by topic, similar to libp2p's pub-sub model. This can be achieved by tagging messages with topics and allowing nodes to subscribe to specific topics.
2. Node Communication: Use the gossip network to propagate blocks and transactions efficiently across the network. Ensure that the network can handle the high throughput required by the consensus protocol.
3. Security and Privacy: Implement measures to protect against spam and ensure the privacy of node communications. This may involve cryptographic techniques and rate limiting.
4. Scalability: Design the network to scale with the number of nodes, ensuring that it remains efficient and responsive as the network grows.

## Gossip Network Infrastructure Abstraction (ðŸš§WIPðŸš§)

### 1. Define Basic Types and Protocols

```haskell
-- GossipTypes.hs
data GossipMessage = GossipMessage {
    topic     :: Topic,
    payload   :: ByteString,
    timestamp :: UTCTime,
    sender    :: NodeId
}

data Topic = Topic Text
data Subscription = Subscription {
    topics    :: Set Topic,
    nodeId    :: NodeId,
    timestamp :: UTCTime
}
```

### 2. Implement Core Gossip Protocol

Message Propagation:

```haskell
-- GossipProtocol.hs
class GossipProtocol m where
    -- Broadcast message to peers
    broadcast :: GossipMessage -> m ()
    -- Subscribe to topics
    subscribe :: Set Topic -> m ()
    -- Unsubscribe from topics 
    unsubscribe :: Set Topic -> m ()
    -- Receive messages for subscribed topics
    receive :: m (Maybe GossipMessage)
```

Peer Management:

```haskell
-- PeerManager.hs
data PeerInfo = PeerInfo {
    peerId        :: NodeId,
    subscriptions :: Set Topic,
    lastSeen      :: UTCTime
}

class PeerManager m where
    addPeer    :: PeerInfo -> m ()
    removePeer :: NodeId -> m ()
    getPeers   :: Topic -> m [PeerInfo]
```

### 3. Block Propagation

Define Block Message Types:

```haskell
-- BlockGossip.hs
data BlockGossipMessage blk = 
    NewBlock (Header blk) (Point blk)
  | BlockRequest (Point blk)
  | BlockResponse blk
```

Implement Block Propagation Protocol:

```haskell
-- BlockPropagation.hs
class BlockPropagation m blk where
    -- Announce new block to network
    announceBlock :: Header blk -> m ()
    -- Request full block from peers
    requestBlock  :: Point blk -> m (Maybe blk)
    -- Handle incoming block announcements
    handleBlockAnnouncement :: Header blk -> m ()
```

### 4. Transaction Propagation

```haskell
-- TransactionGossip.hs
class TransactionPropagation m tx where
    -- Broadcast new transaction
    broadcastTx :: tx -> m ()
    -- Receive new transactions
    receiveTx   :: m (Maybe tx)
    -- Validate and process received transaction
    handleTx    :: tx -> m Bool
```

### 5. Topic Management

Define Topic Structure:

```haskell
-- TopicManager.hs
data TopicTree = TopicNode {
    topicName     :: Text,
    subTopics     :: Map Text TopicTree,
    subscribers   :: Set NodeId
}

class TopicManager m where
    createTopic    :: Text -> m Topic
    deleteTopic    :: Topic -> m ()
    addSubscriber  :: Topic -> NodeId -> m ()
    removeSubscriber :: Topic -> NodeId -> m ()
```

Implement Topic Filtering:

```haskell
-- TopicFilter.hs
class TopicFilter m where
    -- Filter messages by topic
    filterByTopic :: Topic -> GossipMessage -> m Bool
    -- Get all messages for a topic
    getTopicMessages :: Topic -> m [GossipMessage]
```

### 6. Message Deduplication and Caching

```haskell
-- MessageCache.hs
class MessageCache m where
    -- Add message to cache
    cacheMessage :: GossipMessage -> m ()
    -- Check if message exists in cache
    isMessageCached :: GossipMessage -> m Bool
    -- Clean old messages from cache
    cleanCache :: UTCTime -> m ()
```

### 7. Rate Limiting and Flow Control

```haskell
-- RateLimit.hs
class RateLimit m where
    -- Check if message can be sent
    checkRateLimit :: NodeId -> Topic -> m Bool
    -- Update rate limit counters
    updateRateLimit :: NodeId -> Topic -> m ()
```

### 8. Message Authentication

```haskell
-- MessageAuth.hs
class MessageAuth m where
    -- Sign message
    signMessage :: GossipMessage -> m SignedMessage
    -- Verify message signature
    verifyMessage :: SignedMessage -> m Bool
```

### 9. Privacy Control

```haskell
-- PrivacyControl.hs
class PrivacyControl m where
    -- Check if peer is allowed to receive message
    checkPrivacy :: NodeId -> Topic -> m Bool
    -- Apply privacy filters to message
    applyPrivacyFilters :: GossipMessage -> m GossipMessage
```
